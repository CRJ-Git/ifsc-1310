  <h1>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h1>
  <h2>By Christian Johnston</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is an interesting concept that prioritizes content as the foundation of the presentation of a website, and with CSS and Javascript enhancing that content.
  Because older models of technology may not be able to use the tools needed to enchance websites and display them (and some websites wont even use them at all), the most important piece of any accessable site is the content itself.
  If the content can be presented well, then CSS and javascript are more of a way of enhancing the presentation, rather than being the main method of presentation.
  Well structured content is the most important piece of a website, but to reach all audiences, we should also present it in a way that each person can experience that content personally, regardless of ability.</p>
  <p>I personally agree with this format, as the basis for any information is the actual information itself and without a good structure, that information is just wasted on an audience who wont ingest it.
  Its kind of like a layering system.  First, you need content and structure.  Then you add visual style presentation like color and themes.  Finally some scripting to give it some appealing features like digital transitions and parallax.</p>
  <h3> I like to think of it like this:</h3>  
  <ul>
      <li>Content is important structurally, and well made content has good grammar and proper HTML structure that is easy to follow.  
      A house needs 4 walls, a roof, a floor, and some doors.  A good house has a strong foundation, well made materials, and a good floor plan.  Blind people may not be able to enjoy the color of their house,
      but they still need a roof and walls!</li>
  
  <li>Next we need some flair.  Not the buttons at chotchkies but something similar in function.  We need something to not only pull the audience into the presentation, but also convey feeling and expression.
  We do this through CSS or cascading style sheets.  By adding style to the elements of our structured content, we can give life to our content and add feeling to the audience.
  By using CSS, we can also enhance the structure of our content, and allow for more customization of presentation.  A gray house with no windows is still a house and works just as well as any
  other house, but what if we had paint on the outside to make people feel welcome?  How about some windows to let in light?  What about a garden out front?  These are things CSS can do.</li>
  
  <li>Finally we look at the enhancements we can add through javascript.  Through some extra programming, we can modify the behavior of our site and give it features that would appeal to people who
  appreciate these kinds of features based on the target audience.  Think of javascript as adding electricity, plumbing, and AC, these are not exactly necessary features of a house, but add functionality
  and technology to the house and modernize it with amenities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In modern web development, it is important to understand the intersection of presentation and audience and how to add all of the elements together for the full presentation.  The most important part is the content itself,
  but through progressive enhancement, we can ensure that all audiences can enjoy and injest whatever material you are trying to present in your website by understanding the interaction between all three methods.

  <p>A good article I found that talks about progressive enhancement is <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement/">This One</a> by WebFX.com that explains how the different layers of progressive enhancement can affect a website.</p>
