        <h2>A Brief History of Monkeys in Space</h2>
        <p>Space is cool.  Monkeys are cool.  What if we combined the two?  Well some scientists back in the 1950's decided to do just that!
        In the aftermath of World War II, the United States of America entered into a new kind of war, a cold war, in which several countries
        such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and other allied countries engaged in an arms race and by proxy, a
        technological race as well.  To keep up with growing fears of a Soviet attack, the USA decided they needed new aerospace technology
        to keep up with soviet advancements in both domestic and military sciences.  Scientists took the concept of the V2 rocket developed
        by Germany near the end of the war, and started creating their own missles and rockets capable of carrying both destructive and 
        scientific payloads.  To test these new devices for travel, the countries that were developing the devices used animals to
        test their viability as a transportation option.</p>
