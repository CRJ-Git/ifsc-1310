        <h2>A Brief History of Monkeys in Space</h2>
        <p>Space is cool. Monkeys are cool. What if we combined the two?  Well some scientists back in the 1950's decided to do just that!
        In the aftermath of World War II, the United States of America entered into a new kind of war, a cold war, in which several countries
        such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and other allied countries engaged in an arms race and by proxy, a
        technological race as well. To keep up with growing fears of a Soviet attack, the USA decided they needed new aerospace technology
        to keep up with soviet advancements in both domestic and military sciences. Scientists took the concept of the V2 rocket developed
        by Germany near the end of the war, and started creating their own missles and rockets capable of carrying both destructive and 
        scientific payloads. To test these new devices for travel, the countries that were developing the devices used animals to
        test their viability as a transportation option.</p>

                <h3>Gordo <em>"Old Reliable"</em></h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>One of the first monkeys to experience space travel, Gordo was chosen for testing of the effects of space travel
                on primates in 1958. He was placed aboard a <strong>Jupiter AM-13 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile</strong> (IRBM) for its mobility
                and reliability. The mission was a success and after <q>about 15 minutes</q> of flight time, the missile landed over
                1500 miles away and monitors had recorded that no ill effects had transpired during the flight. Sadly there was a 
                mechanical failure in the parachute system and Gordo most likely died on impact when the nose cone of the rocket touched 
                down in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                    <h4>Vehicle</h4>
                <p>Gordo rode on a Jupiter AM-13 IRBM. This missile was developed initially as a nuclear weapon delivery system,
                but the project was also used by the United States Air Force to test biological payloads and systems.</p>
                    <h4>Flight</h4>
                <p>The flight containing Gordo took off from Cape Canaveral on December 13, 1958. The rocket flew 1500 miles, 
                reached a height of 310 miles, and landed in an unknown location in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
