  <h2>Revision and Reflection Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p>Reflecting on the work I did this semester, I think the things I enjoyed the most was learning all the different markups and how to properly structure documents.  I think I struggled with positioning and understanding CSS structure the most, I feel like I spent countless hours trying to move elements just right and I think it ate up a large amount of my time working.
  The class was fun and enjoyable, and I learned a large amount about the process that goes into web development, from progressive enhancement and the box model, to how websites function and the things "under the hood" so to speak.
  Both Front-end and Back-end work is necessary to create a functional and effective website, and by learning both, I have a good foundation of understanding of web development.
  I asked for some feedback for my revised website and the only thing I really got back was to clean up some of the blank space in my main page next to the images, so I tried to clean that up and get the website to flow a little bit better. 
  I think in the future, I will need to set aside more time for positioning so that I can get things just the way I like and not have to settle.</p>
